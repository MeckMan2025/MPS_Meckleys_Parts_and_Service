📘 PRODUCT BRIEF — Meckley’s Parts & Service Website Redesign

Version 1.0

Prepared by: [Your Name]

Date: [Today’s Date]

⸻

1. Project Overview

Meckley’s Parts & Service (MPS) is a family-owned auto repair, towing, salvage, and parts business serving Central Iowa since 1977. The company operates a large, well-organized salvage yard and offers full-service automotive repair, metal recycling, scrap removal, and specialty parts support — including a strong niche in 1970s–1980s Chevrolet pickup trucks.

The current website does not reflect the scale, professionalism, history, or brand personality of the business. This project will create a completely redesigned digital experience that modernizes the brand while celebrating its rural-industrial heritage, strong reputation, and wide service offering.
